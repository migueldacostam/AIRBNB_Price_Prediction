This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate the average annual nightly prices of Airbnb accommodations in Barcelona. Key variables such as geographic location, available amenities, and other factors influencing pricing will be utilized. While the booking date is an important variable in determining prices, our focus will be on predicting the annual average price per night, providing a more stable view of nightly costs. Our model will offer valuable insights into market dynamics, enabling hosts and guests to make more informed decisions.
